  The basic blocks in this model are going to be the exact same as the ones in the other two models. Rather than explaining that again,
it is easier to understand how this model would be different, and how to use this model to structure the code. Uisng this model will 
likely prove to be more efficient than using other models, but the best combination would be a mix of the integrate model, and the
incremental model. The reason behind this is because the incremental model has a nice gradual increase in design complexity: start with
essentials and evolve. The integrate model is based on finding off-the-shelf software/reusable components and integrating it into
oneâ€™s own system, instead of building said components from scratch. In the case of assignment two, one requeirment includes incorporating
a databse, and finding a  database for a school may not be that hard. One could then find that database and use parts that are needed for
the current CURSE program. A user interface is just as easy to find. The two groups could manipulate acquired code and configure it to
work in their  system. This model is more of a strategy that can be implemented into other models and it is important to cite and
give credit to the original creator of the code if integrate and configure is ever used.
