 The basic blocks in this model are going to be the exact same as the ones in the other two models. Rather than explain that again it is easier to understand how this model would be different, and how to use this model to structure the code. Uisng this model will likely 
prove to be more efficient than using other models, but the best combination would be a mix of the integrate model, and the incremental model. The reason behind this is because the incremental model has a nice gradual increase in design complexity, start off basic and
then evolve. The integrate model says to use the internet to integrate existing software and reusable components into one’s own system instead of building it from scratch. In the case of assignment two, one requeirment includes incorporating a databse, and finding a 
database for a school may not be that hard. One could then use that database, and throw out what they don’t need from it, and keep what they need. A user interface is just as easy to find. The two groups could manipulate already made code and configure it to work in their 
system. This model is more of a strategy that can be implemented into other models and it is important to cite and give credit to the original creator of the code if integrate and configure is ever used.
